# From domains to schema

The domains and subdomains exports in cascade resolvers and typedefs.

Here we combine them all.

## DX improvement opportunities.

Currently we need to do a lot of coding-time configuration to import and export the resolvers and the typedefs.

A good improvement would be to have some build time logic taking care of this.
